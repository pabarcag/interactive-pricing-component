# Frontend Mentor - Interactive pricing component

![Design preview for the Interactive pricing component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this interactive pricing component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers (details provided below)

### Page view and pricing totals

Here are the different page view ranges and the corresponding monthly price totals:

- 10K pageviews / $8 per month
- 50K pageviews / $12 per month
- 100K pageviews / $16 per month
- 500k pageviews / $24 per month
- 1M pageviews / $36 per month

If the visitor switches the toggle to yearly billing, a 25% discount should be applied to all prices.

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BEM
- Flexbox
- GRID
- SASS
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I learned a lot in this challenge. Starting with CSS, I learned how to customize range input, since I had no idea that was possible, I also learned how to do layout effects with grid (change element positions which within the HTML flow is impossible), I learned how to create a simple switch. Enjoy doing the CSS.

Now with Javascript, I feel that it is not the most optimal solution that I did. But, being the second challenge I do, it's not bad at all.
Here I learned a little about event delegation, control input type events, a simple switch validation.
Although I'm not satisfied with what I did in logic, I have to keep learning!
